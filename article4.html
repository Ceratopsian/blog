            <p class="article-body">Intellectual Property, or IP, refers to the protection of creations originating from the human mind. These creations span various forms, including artistic works, inventions, designs, symbols, and names, which can all hold significant value. IP rights allow creators to own their work and decide how it is used. Some primary categories of IP rights include:</p>

            <h1 class="article-heading">Key Types of Intellectual Property Protection</h1>
            <p class="article-body">Each IP category has a distinct form of protection, ensuring creators maintain control over their work:</p>
            <p class="article-body">• <strong>Patents</strong>: Patents protect inventions, granting the owner exclusive rights to manufacture or use the product. If someone else attempts to use the invention without permission, the patent holder can seek legal action.</p>
            <p class="article-body">• <strong>Trademarks</strong>: This protects brand elements like names, symbols, and slogans, creating an identity around a product or service. A trademark holder has legal recourse if their brand is misused by others.</p>
            <p class="article-body">• <strong>Copyright</strong>: Copyright covers original works of authorship, from literature to music and art, allowing creators to restrict others from copying or distributing their work without permission.</p>
            <p class="article-body">• <strong>Trade Secrets</strong>: These are pieces of confidential information that give a business a competitive edge. Trade secrets are protected as long as they remain undisclosed and offer a business advantage.</p>

            <h1 class="article-heading">Fair Use: Limited IP Flexibility</h1>
            <p class="article-body">Fair use is a legal doctrine allowing limited use of copyrighted material without obtaining permission, as long as it serves specific purposes, such as:</p>
            <p class="article-body">• <strong>Education</strong>: Teachers and students use copyrighted works for learning, such as analyzing literature or reproducing artwork for assignments.</p>
            <p class="article-body">• <strong>Criticism/Review</strong>: Using parts of copyrighted works to critique, as in book or movie reviews.</p>
            <p class="article-body">• <strong>News</strong>: Using snippets of videos or images for reporting purposes.</p>
            <p class="article-body">Fair use ensures that copyrighted material can support learning, journalism, and public critique without infringing on the creator’s rights.</p>
