            <h1 class="article-heading">What is Freelancing?</h1>
            <p class="article-body">In today’s flexible job market, "freelancing" has become a popular career choice for those who value independence and control over their work. Freelancing, often done by freelancers or freelance workers, generally refers to being self-employed and working on a project basis without a long-term commitment to any single employer. It can be a rewarding way to gain hands-on experience in a chosen field while selecting projects that align with your skills and interests. But is it right for everyone? Let’s dive into some of the pros and cons of freelancing, highlighting factors that might make or break this career path for you.</p>

                    <h1 style="color: rgb(19, 94, 19);" class="subbox-heading">Benefits</h1>
                    <p class="subbox-body">• <strong>Flexibility</strong> - Freelancing allows you to choose who you work with, the types of projects you take on, and how you manage your time. This can be especially beneficial for those seeking part-time work or a customized work schedule, helping to reduce stress by enabling you to manage your workload around other commitments.</p>
                    <p class="subbox-body">• <strong>Control</strong> - Control Over Workload Another appealing aspect is the control you have over your workload. Freelancers can pick smaller projects that fit easily into their schedule or take on larger, more challenging work when they have more time. By choosing the work you love most, you can often avoid some of the less exciting tasks that come with a traditional job.</p>
                    <p class="subbox-body">• <strong>Independence</strong> - For those who thrive on independence, freelancing can be the ideal setup. There’s no need to stick to a 9-to-5 office schedule or rely on coworkers for project progress. If you’re comfortable working alone, freelancing offers the freedom to operate at your own pace and in your own space.</p>

                    <h1 style="color: rgb(94, 19, 19);" class="subbox-heading">Challenges</h1>
                    <p class="subbox-body">• <strong>Lack of Benefits</strong> - One of the main drawbacks is that freelancers don’t typically receive benefits like retirement plans (pensions) or paid time off. Freelancers are responsible for securing their own coverage and setting aside savings, which can be a significant financial consideration when comparing freelance work to traditional employment.</p>
                    <p class="subbox-body">• <strong>Irregular Work Opportunities</strong> - Freelancing can be unpredictable, especially when starting out. Projects may come and go, and securing a steady flow of work can be challenging. Client projects sometimes get delayed or cut short, leaving freelancers to hustle for the next gig. Many experience stretches of high activity followed by quieter periods, making budgeting and planning more difficult.</p>
                    <p class="subbox-body">• <strong>Isolation</strong> - Working independently can lead to feelings of isolation, as freelancers often miss out on the social aspect of being part of a team. The sense of camaraderie that comes with working for a company can be hard to replicate, especially for those who thrive in a collaborative environment.</p>

            <p class="article-body">Overall, whether freelancing is better or more ideal than a traditional 9-5 is dependant on the individual and their circumstances. When choosing the correct choice yourself, it is crucial to weigh up the benefits and challenges and what is sustainable at the time.

            <h1 class="article-heading">What would I choose?</h1>
            <p class="article-body">Personally, while I believe I would enjoy the variety and opportunities freelance work could provide, I would prefer to have stable employment and the security that a full time job provides. Being able to work with others in my profession and learn from them is also another extremely important factor in my decision. While freelance work can still provide opportunities to work alongside others, I feel the uncertainty and potential isolation would not be beneficial or enjoyable as a career.</p>
