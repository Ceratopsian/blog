            <h1 class="article-heading">Building Your Online Presence in Web Development</h1>
            <p class="article-body">Creating a strong online presence is essential for web developers looking to attract clients, potential employers, or collaborators. A well-rounded online profile can showcase your skills and demonstrate your commitment to learning and growth in a fast-evolving field. Here’s how you can establish a professional online footprint tailored to web development.</p>
            <h1 style="margin-top: 90px;" class="article-heading">Where To Start: Building Your Online Presence</h1>
            <p class="article-body">• <strong>Portfolio Website or Blog</strong>: Establishing a personal website allows you to showcase your skills, completed projects, and learning progress. A portfolio provides a centralized space for potential clients or employers to view your best work. Include live demos, links to code repositories, and even technical blog posts if you enjoy writing about coding challenges or new skills. Regularly updating this site with new projects demonstrates your active involvement and adaptability in web development.</p>
            <p class="article-body">• <strong>Social Media and Professional Profiles</strong>: Linking your portfolio to platforms like LinkedIn and GitHub helps create a cohesive online presence. LinkedIn is essential for connecting with other professionals, while GitHub is particularly valuable for sharing code, tracking progress on projects, and contributing to open-source initiatives. Platforms like X can also be great for following industry trends and sharing quick updates or insights.</p>

            <p class="article-body">• <strong>Create and Maintain a Personal Website</strong>: A personal site acts as a comprehensive portfolio, linking all your relevant profiles in one place. This site should reflect your skills and personality while providing easy navigation to different projects, skills, and coding examples.</p>
            <p class="article-body">• <strong>Consistent Updates</strong>: Keep your work fresh by adding new projects or blog posts regularly. This might be a monthly update, a recent project summary, or even an explanation of a recent coding challenge. Frequent updates can keep your audience engaged and increase visibility.</p>
