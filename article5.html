            <h1 class="article-heading">Networking Explained</h1>
            <p class="article-body">Networking is the process of building connections with people in your field or those with similar professional interests.

            <h1 class="article-heading">Types of Networking</h1>
            <p class="article-body">There are two main ways to network: <i>online networking</i> and <i>in-person networking</i>.</p>
            <p class="article-body">• <strong>Online Networking</strong>: Conducted on platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, and even specialized forums for industries like game development, online networking allows people to form professional relationships and exchange information virtually. By sharing expertise, staying active in discussions, and connecting with industry experts, online networking can be a powerful tool to stay updated on industry trends.</p>
            <p class="article-body">• <strong>In-Person Networking</strong>: This includes events such as conferences, workshops, job fairs, and industry meet-ups. These gatherings allow face-to-face connections, which often build stronger relationships than virtual ones. In-person networking is effective for creating lasting impressions and exchanging ideas and resources more personally.</p>
